    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a staple of Thai cooking. Adjust the spices to your own tastes for a really great use for leftover rice!! I get the basil from a local Asian market. It has a different flavor than that of regular basil and makes all the difference in this recipe. It is fast and fairly easy to make, but requires constant stirring.</p>

    <ul> <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup peanut oil for frying</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked jasmine rice, chilled</li>
        <li>6 large cloves garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <li>2 serrano peppers, crushed</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, seeded and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups sweet Thai basil</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, sliced (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ cup cilantro sprigs (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol> <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>
            Step 2
            Heat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat until the oil begins to smoke. Add the garlic and serrano peppers, stirring quickly. Stir in the chicken, bell pepper, onion and oyster sauce mixture; cook until the chicken is no longer pink. Raise heat to high and stir in the chilled rice; stir quickly until the sauce is blended with the rice. Use the back of a spoon to break up any rice sticking together.</li>
        <li>
            Step 3
            Remove from heat and mix in the basil leaves. Garnish with sliced cucumber and cilantro as desired.
